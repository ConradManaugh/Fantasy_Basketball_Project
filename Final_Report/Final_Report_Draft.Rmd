### Introduction


Fantasy sports have been a popular way for fans to get more knowledgeable and interested into the sports they love. One of the most popular fantasy sports people participate in is fantasy basketball for the NBA. Everyone wants to have the best team over the other members in their competitive standard league. Thus, the problem becomes how to select the best player in each round from the remaining list of players? What dataset should we look at from players? Which category is the most crucial for fantasy player to win the top one? 

Again, one of the most popular fantasy sports people participate in is fantasy basketball for the NBA. It has a vast number of fans. There is no doubt they all want to get a good team. They can act as owners, managers and coaches of their team by drafting a team. Many of them are new to this game. Once a team has been drafted, the league determines which statistics will be counted as fantasy points and how many fantasy points each statistic is worth. For example, a block counts for 1 fantasy points while a steal counts for 2. After this has been set and the NBA season begins, each night the fantasy points for each participant is totaled and the participant at the end of the regular season with the most fantasy points wins.Therefore, when drafting players one needs to be able to analyze players pasts statistics, predict future player statistics and weigh them based on the determine fantasy point scoring system to draft a team that will make them the optimal amount of points for the season. Thus, it is very helpful for them if they can use some tools or data set of the basketball data. That is why we are going to create a shiny app to help users get familiar with players and their data. We believe it will be a great tool for them to enjoy and select the best players in each round. 

DESCRIPTION OF DATA

Our idea includes many skills from the course which is about the statistical programming. For example, we are using the knowledge of how to import a dataset from the csv file online. There does need the skills of subsetting data from the course. We divide the position of basketball into our shiny app. Later on, we provide some graphs between many variables to see why such a player is good or bad to pick at this point. We have used many packages, such as ggplot2, readr, and stirngr. We also clean data by the skill of tidy data we have learned from the class. We are providing visual representation of the data in the form of graphs which will compare players, as well as, coding a shiny app for fantasy league participants to easily customize the data pipeline to their personal fantasy league rules. Overall, we have already using a lot of skills from courses.
 
 
### Related Work

Some people had tried to analyze the data to prepare for the draft strategy for the new season in 14-team basketball league. He took the data from cutting and copying on ESPN.com and NBA.com. He put a flat file of the top 250 players from the previous season. Then he created a binary variable for the top 42 players (3 players per 14 teams). The “1” means the player is a top 3 players, otherwise he is not. He used 28 independent variables from the previous season to identify the “top 42 players”. He came up with conclusions that field-goal percentage, assist and blocks are the difference-makers because most players in NBA are good at points and rebounds. However, assists and blocks are rarer so that they are more valuable to a fantasy team. 

Other projects include computing the average stats for each categories of players. Some of the other are having the graph comparing the specific player and league’s average. Or group comes up data calculating the standard deviation to see how far away a player is from average.

Comparing to other projects, our group use the bigger dataset. Most projects are using previous year’s dataset for predicting the future data. We use the data in the past five years to make a more precise prediction for player’s future performance. One of the most difference is that our group use the Shiny app in R. Most projects online are only included complex graphs or prolix passages that make reader hard to understand their ideas. For us, we make the Shiny app that looks clear for people to manipulate. For example, we have provided a lot of input table on the left of our app, such as the weight of point, the weight of rebound, player name, the player you would like to compare to and player stat to study. People can input their data in each of them. Then they can look at each player’s trend data whether they are getting better or worse or the graph comparison between players. It is very simple for people to control in the app. Most of the data fantasy NBA participants want it exist in the app. If they want to see the difference between players, they also can type in two players’ name to see the comparison. Thus, user can figure out what type of player they are looking for. Thus, our app is serving as a recommender for fantasy basketball player to select what kind of player they want. 



### Methods


The methodology for our group project will closely follow the analytical data pipelines phases. As we need to import data related to basketball players off the internet we will need to use SelectorGadget as well as the rvest package to scrape this information offline. We plan to import the data from http://www.basketball-reference.com assuming that we have continued success in scraping from that site. Then we will have to tidy the data, so it is likely we will need stringr, rvest, and tidyr. 


Our goal in tidying the data is to have the data organized so that each player’s average score during a year in the NBA is an observation. So, for every year a player has played in the NBA they would have an extra observation. Each observation would contain the name, organization, position, and age of the player. Along with these three factor variables and one-time variable, likely an integer, we will have statistics variables for the average of the season, likely some form of numeric. The desired statistics follow the most widely used statistics in fantasy NBA under the point-based scoring method, where each statistical category counts for a set number of points. The categories likely to be used are points, rebounds, assists, offensive blocks, defensive blocks, steals, fouls, turnovers, field goal percentage, and free throw percentage.


How we plan to model our NBA league will directly impact how we transform the data, so it must be discussed. NBA fantasy can be done many ways, but the way we are going to be analyzing is based on the fantasy points method of NBA fantasy. In this method the group playing sets each statistic to have a point value and the points for your fantasy team are calculated real time. At the end of the season those with more points win. This model seemed the most straight forward in implementing our project. It will also allow for a large amount of user customization when the project is done, as a group of friends can decide how many points each statistic is worth, or if they are worth none. 


Then we must transform the data of into some sort of prediction for the coming years data. This part can be done through time series modeling. We would take every individual player individual statistics and use a time series model to predict how they will perform in that statistic next year. Now we have a new transformed data for each player containing predictions for their average statistics per game next year. We would then allow for user input to give statistics more weight in totaling points. So, the final dataset that we show is our prediction data set multiplied by a vector of user weight inputs, as well as former years averages multiplied by user inputs.


The visualization part concerns how we display this information in graphs, as well as how we display the entire shiny application. At this moment the overall layout for our shiny app consists of a tab for changing settings on one side, a tab for picking players on the other side, and a list of picked players for each team on the bottom. On the side with players we will have rows sorted by players expected total score next year, highest first. These players will descend the page, each player taking up a row. On the players will be a summary of who they are, along with the current years statistics and our predicted statistics. Next to these numbers will be a button that switches to graphs pertaining to this player. By clicking on multiple boxes, we can see different player comparisons. 



Regarding the graphs that we will compose using our data, the graphs are either comparative between players, or analyzing an individual player over time. When comparing players, we will use side by side bar plots with the x axis being source of points and the y axis being amount of points. The bars will be sorted by individual statistic, points with points and assists with assists. This allows direct comparison between the two chosen players to determine who is better at what category, as well as who is better. When analyzing an individual player change throughout time we will use a scatterplot graph with years on the x axis and total points on the y axis. This scatterplot will be accompanied by a best fit regression line to be determined while analyzing the data, although we suspect it to be parabolic with players getting worse with age after they peak. Along with normal points from actual years we will highlight our predicted point, which is the point that our best fit line intersects with next year. We could also implement it where if a user clicks on a predicted or past point they can see a summary of what statistics a player specializes in during any year.

In summation we will have to write code that retrieves the data for current players as well as these players former years. We then must write code that sorts this data into tidy and usable datasets. Then we need to write a time series model that takes players past NBA performances and predicts next years performance. We then must code a shiny interface that takes these predicted and historic point values and displays them along with players name, team, and position. Lastly, our shiny application must have a way to create graphs that explain different players differences as well as the idea behind our prediction.




### Discussion


### Conclusion
In general, our goal is to help fantasy basketball fans draft their players by analyzing players’ past statistics in order to make the optimal team for themselves. We will create the tool for fantasy NBA participants who will use it during the draft to come out the best team selections. Inside the app, we will follow the analytical data pipelines phases. We are going to import data from website, and then we will tidy the data by using stringr, rvest, and tidyr. 
For the dataset, we will organize each player’s average score. Each observation will contain the name, team name, position, weight, age, and so on. The scores will come out by the algorithm of fantasy inside, likely each statistical category counts for a set number of points. The variable include points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals, turnovers, field goal percentage, and free throw percentage. 
We will also be using the data to predict for the coming years data by time series modeling. The method is to take every individual player’ statistics to a use series model, so we can predict how individuals will perform next year. After that, the user will be able to see the prediction data set multiplied by a vector of user weight inputs. 
Inside the App, we will also include the visualization part. The overall layout for shiny app will consist a tab for changing setting on one side. There is another tab for clicking players on the other side. There will be a list of selected players on the bottom. Inside the player click, we will have rows sorted by players expected total score in upcoming year in descending order. In each player’s page, we will include some graphs.
	For the graphs, we will compare players and analyze individual player over time. For comparing players, will be using side by side bar plots that the x-axis represents points and y-axis represents the transferred fantasy points. It will be sorted by many categories of statistics, such as points, rebounds, assists, and so on. We will be able to see directly who is better according to the graphs. For the individual player graph, we will be using a scatterplot graph with years on the x-axis and the total fantasy points on the y-axis. It will be presented by the best fit regression line to be determined. 
	Again, our fantasy team selector tool will include the graphical representations of current and past statistics of players and graphical comparisons of players. By looking at some pre-existing projects, I find out that out project’s novelty is the convenience and clear path to the success of the fantasy NBA life. Some articles are being too long or complex analysis of basketball itself. Others are having no graphs or comparisons between players. Our app will help people tidy the data so that they can click whatever player they want to look at inside the app. What is more, when they have trouble at deciding to select player, they can open the charts or comparison graphs to see what kind of categories they need to. Overall, I think it will be a great tool for fantasy NBA participants to use.
