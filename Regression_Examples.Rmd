##Just going to use the data to see what different methods of forecasting look like.
```{r}
library(readr)
All_Season_Stats=read_csv("All_Season_Stats.csv")

tail(All_Season_Stats,25)
##The data as it stands could be reorganized, I am going to reorgainzie it by season with an emphasys on player age,so each player will have 5 observations at max.





```
```{r}

Name=rep(NA,5*length(All_Season_Stats$Player))#Making the data set full with NA's first, this will have 5 repeated names for each player
Pos2=(NA,5*length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will repeat the position of the player listed in this data set, as I assume nobody changed for simplicity.

data.frame=c()

  
  
}
```
