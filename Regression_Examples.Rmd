##Just going to use the data to see what different methods of forecasting look like.
```{r Looking at All_Season_Stats}
library(readr)
All_Season_Stats=read_csv("All_Season_Stats.csv")

tail(All_Season_Stats,25)
##The data as it stands could be reorganized, I am going to reorgainzie it by season with an emphasys on player age,so each player will have 5 observations at max.





```
```{r Creating Name}

Name=rep(NA,5*length(All_Season_Stats$Player))#Making the data set full with NA's first, this will have 5 repeated names for each player, all data is yearly averages per game for different stats

i=1 


while(floor(i/5)+1<=length(All_Season_Stats$Player)){###the floor(i/5)+1 always rounds to the first name for the first 5 entries and the second name for the next 5 entries

Name[i]=All_Season_Stats$Player[floor(i/5)+1]
Name[i+1]=All_Season_Stats$Player[floor(i/5)+1]
Name[i+2]=All_Season_Stats$Player[floor(i/5)+1]
Name[i+3]=All_Season_Stats$Player[floor(i/5)+1]
Name[i+4]=All_Season_Stats$Player[floor(i/5)+1]

i=i+5
}
Name=as.factor(Name)
tail(Name,25)##Now names are factors that repeat 5 times in the data set for each name
```




```{r}


Pos2=rep(NA,5*length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will repeat the position of the player listed in this data set, as I assume nobody changed for simplicity.

Age=rep(NA,5*length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will end up being a list of ages, starting at current age and going down one for the past years

##Tm I am not going to use for anaylsys

#I won't be using games played, games started, or minutes played in the analysis

Year=rep(NA,5*length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will contain years 2018 through 2014

FG=rep(NA,5*length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will contain a record of fieldgoals made on average per game in years 2014 to 2018

#I won't be using field goals attempted

Bhind_Arc=rep(NA,5*length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will contain the 3 point field goals made per game through the years.

In_Arc=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))#This will contain 2 point field goals made per game throughout the years

FreeT=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will contain free throws made per game throughout the years

OfReb=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will contain offensive rebound made per game thruoghout the seasons

DefReb=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will be like OfReb but for defensive rebounds

##Not going to use total rebounds, as in the shiny app a user can just make OfReb and DefReb the same for this result

Assist=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will be the average assists per game in each season

Steal=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will be the average steals per game in each season

Block=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will be the average blocks per game in each season

TOV=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will be the average turnovers per game in each season

Fouls=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will be the average fouls per game in each season

Points=rep(NA,length(All_Season_Stats$Player))##This will be the average points per game in each season


DatSet=data.frame(Name,Pos2,Age,Year,FG,Bhind_Arc,In_Arc,FreeT,OfReb,DefReb,Assist,Steal,Block,TOV,Fouls,Points)
