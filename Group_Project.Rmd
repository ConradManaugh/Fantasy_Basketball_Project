### Methods


The methodology for our group project will closely follow the analytical data pipelines phases. As we need to import data related to basketball players off the internet we will need to use SelectorGadget as well as the rvest package to scrape this information offline. We plan to import the data from http://www.basketball-reference.com assuming that we have continued success in scraping from that site. Then we will have to tidy the data, so it is likely we will need stringr, rvest, and tidyr. 


  Our goal in tidying the data is to have the data organized so that each playerâ€™s average score during a year in the NBA is an observation. So, for every year a player has played in the NBA they would have an extra observation. Each observation would contain the name, organization, position, and age of the player. Along with these three factor variables and one-time variable, likely an integer, we will have statistics variables for the average of the season, likely some form of numeric. The desired statistics follow the most widely used statistics in fantasy NBA under the point-based scoring method, where each statistical category counts for a set number of points. The categories likely to be used are points, rebounds, assists, offensive blocks, defensive blocks, steals, fouls, turnovers, field goal percentage, and free throw percentage.


  How we plan to model our NBA league will directly impact how we transform the data, so it must be discussed. NBA fantasy can be done many ways, but the way we are going to be analyzing is based on the fantasy points method of NBA fantasy. In this method the group playing sets each statistic to have a point value and the points for your fantasy team are calculated real time. At the end of the season those with more points win. This model seemed the most straight forward in implementing our project. It will also allow for a large amount of user customization when the project is done, as a group of friends can decide how many points each statistic is worth, or if they are worth none. 


  Then we must transform the data of into some sort of prediction for the coming years data. This part can be done through time series modeling. We would take every individual player individual statistics and use a time series model to predict how they will perform in that statistic next year. Now we have a new transformed data for each player containing predictions for their average statistics per game next year. We would then allow for user input to give statistics more weight in totaling points. So, the final dataset that we show is our prediction data set multiplied by a vector of user weight inputs, as well as former years averages multiplied by user inputs.


  The visualization part concerns how we display this information in graphs, as well as how we display the entire shiny application. At this moment the overall layout for our shiny app consists of a tab for changing settings on one side, a tab for picking players on the other side, and a list of picked players for each team on the bottom. On the side with players we will have rows sorted by players expected total score next year, highest first. These players will descend the page, each player taking up a row. On the players will be a summary of who they are, along with the current years statistics and our predicted statistics. Next to these numbers will be a button that switches to graphs pertaining to this player. By clicking on multiple boxes, we can see different player comparisons. 



Regarding the graphs that we will compose using our data, the graphs are either comparative between players, or analyzing an individual player over time. When comparing players, we will use side by side bar plots with the x axis being source of points and the y axis being amount of points. The bars will be sorted by individual statistic, points with points and assists with assists. This allows direct comparison between the two chosen players to determine who is better at what category, as well as who is better. When analyzing an individual player change throughout time we will use a scatterplot graph with years on the x axis and total points on the y axis. This scatterplot will be accompanied by a best fit regression line to be determined while analyzing the data, although we suspect it to be parabolic with players getting worse with age after they peak. Along with normal points from actual years we will highlight our predicted point, which is the point that our best fit line intersects with next year. We could also implement it where if a user clicks on a predicted or past point they can see a summary of what statistics a player specializes in during any year.

  In summation we will have to right code that retrieves the data for current players as well as these players former years. We then must right code that sorts this data into tidy and usable datasets. Then we need to right a time series model that takes players past NBA performances and predicts next years performance. We then must code a shiny interface that takes these predicted and historic point values and displays them along with players name, team, and position. Lastly, our shiny application must have a way to create graphs that explain different players differences as well as the idea behind our prediction.
